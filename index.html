	<p>Sleepy Indy is here to wake you up! This website is here to connect you upcoming local hip-hop/r&b artists,producers,and many other musicians around the local Indianapolis area! You know what that means NO CHICAGO ARTISTS! :) Our goal is to support the ambitions of local music artists in our city by telling their story and sharing their background with hopes of relating and connecting with other music lovers or people living in the Indianapolis area. We want to provide a platform for you, the musician, aspiring musician, and music lover. Through this, we hope to create a positive and encouraging online environment for people seeking to stream, share, and connect with locally made music.</p>
